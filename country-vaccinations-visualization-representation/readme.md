In this report we concluded various thing that as we move further the effeciency of all the countries in handling COVID-19 increases as there many vaccines introduces by many companies. In this project we compared various things from the data which is imported from Kaggle after cleaning and arranging data,

Like:

Q3. What is the comparision with major countries in vaccination process by bar graph?

Q4. What is the progress of India in comparision with major countries?

Q5. How many people vaccinated per 10 thousand in major countries?

We concluded answers such as every country is making efforts in to save the citizens of their respective countries. (Total people vaccinated data is not given by China) By comparision with major countries in vaccination process as till 9th April 2021, we get answer that United States is at the top in giving total vaccination to their citizens than followed by China, India, United Kingdom, Germany than France in these major countries and in giving daily vaccination top company is China followed by India which surpassed United States than followed by United States, United Kingdom, Germany and then France.

If we talk about India, while keep in mind India is one of the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world India is doing well in providing vaccinations to other countries and also running vaccination drive in indian citizens. India is doing quite well but if we look to huge population of India, India has to provide vaccination to their citizens in a massive scale than any country in the world. Because if we compare people vaccinated per 10 thousand in major countries United Kingdom is leading than followed by United States, France, Germany, China and than India comes at last spot in these 5 countries. But it is also a fact that there ate hundreds of country who are below India in this aspects but we have to compare ourself with best not with worst.
